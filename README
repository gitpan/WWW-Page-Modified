NAME
    WWW::Page::Modified - reports when a page was last modified

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Page::Modified;
        my $dm = WWW::Page::Modified->new;
        print $dm->get_modified('http://www.apple.com/');

DESCRIPTION
    The WWW::Page::Modified module attempts to determine when a web page
    was last modified. It does this by examining the HTTP headers, HTML
    headers and the body of the HTML document.

    It will make use of Date::Manip so it is not necessarily the
    quickest of cats.

METHODS
    WWW::Page::Modified->new()
        Creates a new date modified checking object.

    $dm->get_modified($url)
        Returns the date modified or 0. $url can either be an
        <HTTP::Response> object, a URI object or just a string URL.

PLANS
    It needs to cater for more weird and unusual ways of putting dates
    on web pages.
